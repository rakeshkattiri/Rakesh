        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            HTML is an acronym which stands for
            <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> which is used for
            creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by
            Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page. <br /><br />
            <strong>Hyper Text:</strong>
            HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within
            it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to
            a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way
            to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Markup language:</strong> A markup language is a computer
            language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to
            a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and
            dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Web Page:</strong> A web page is a document which is
            commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page
            can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the
            static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create
            static web pages.

            <ul>
            <li>In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a
            contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989,
            he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.</li>

            description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by
            Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will
            learn later in this tutorial.</li>

          <p>
            Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in
            market, the brief introduction about the HTML version is given
            below: <br /><br />
            <strong>HTML 1.0: </strong>The first version of HTML was 1.0, which
            was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was released
            in1991. <br /><br />

            This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was
            standard language version for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to
            support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements
            such as text box, option button, etc. <br /><br />
            <strong>HTML 3.2:</strong> HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in
            early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and
            providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also
            support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an
            official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is
            practically supported by most of the browsers. <br /><br />
            <strong>HTML 4.01:</strong> HTML 4.01 version was released on
            December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language.
            This version is the current official standard, and it provides added
            support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for various
            multimedia elements. <br /><br />
            <strong>HTML5 :</strong> HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText
            Markup language. The first draft of this version was announced in
            January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World
            Wide Web Consortium), and another one is WHATWG( Web Hypertext
            Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the
            development of HTML 5 version, and still, it is under development.

          <p> ☛ HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific
            content. Markup means that with HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how it is presented. Visual
            representations are defined by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and realized by browsers. Still existing elements that
            allow for such, like e.g. font, "are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors". <br> <br>
            ☛ HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language. HTML tags
            provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page.
            <br>
            An element usually consists of an opening tag , a closing tag, which contain the
element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:

for better interpretability. Doctype declarations are not HTML tags and belong at the very top of a document. This
topic explains the structure and declaration of various doctypes in HTML
<br>HTML5 is not based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), and therefore does not require a reference
to a DTD (Document Type Definition).
